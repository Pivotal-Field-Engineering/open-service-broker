# Open Service Broker

### Status
Develop Branch:[![Develop branch Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/swisscom/open-service-broker.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/swisscom/open-service-broker)
## Introduction

Open Service Broker is an implementation of the [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.11/spec.md). It enables platforms such as [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) & [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to provision and manage services.

Open Service Broker is built in a modular way and one service broker can host multiple services.

Service broker offers extra functionality regarding Billing, Backup/Restore on top of the Open Service Broker API.

Services can be provisioned synchronously and/or asynchronously and the goal of this project is to provide a framework with which any service can easily be provisioned.

The following flow chart shows interactions for service provisioning and service binding for MongoDB Enterprise service.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Java 1.8
- MySQL / MariaDB Server


## Deployment
### Build

Build Service Broker using the `gradlew` script in the root directory of the repository.

```bash
$ ./gradlew clean build -x test -x integrationTest -x functionalTest -Ptomcat
```

The parameter called _tomcat_ is for controlling if a tomcat runtime is integrated into the war.

Command below gives you a self executable jar 
```bash
$ ./gradlew clean build -x test -x integrationTest -x functionalTest 
```


### Database

To run the service broker locally a mariadb or mysql database with name _CFbroker_ is required.
The database tables will be generated automatically by the application. See the configuration section for more details.

#### Use Docker for MariaDB setup
```bash
docker run --name appc-cf-service-broker-db -e MYSQL_DATABASE=CFBroker -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes -p 3306:3306 -d mariadb
```

### Run

To run the built artifact, from the root directory the following commands can be executed:
```bash
java -jar broker/build/libs/service-broker-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war 
```

or

```bash
./gradlew broker:bootRun
```

At the time being, Service Broker is recommended to run with only one instance to avoid concurrency issues.
This issue will be fixed soon.

### IDE/IntelliJ
When importing this project into IntelliJ, select the "create separate module per source set option".
![Intelli import](./img/intellij_import.png)



### Cloud Foundry interactions

Follow the [documentation](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html) to register the broker
to Cloud Foundry.

Before a `cf create-service-broker` or `update-service-broker` call is made, please make sure that Service Broker is configured correctly.
For configuring the catalog, see the service definition section.

### JAVA_OPTS
```bash
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC"
```

## Configuration

The configuration file for the Service Broker is located under

[`broker/src/main/resources/application.yml`](broker/src/main/resources/application.yml)

## Service Definitions

Service definitions define the catalog and link to a corresponding Groovy service provider class specified by the `internalName` properly. The provider class is lazy loaded at the first provisionning request. 

### Get service definition

Via the example call below, service definitions for a given service id can be retrieved.

```bash
curl -u 'username:password' -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/custom/admin/service-definition/{service_id}'
```

### Add service definition

Service Broker provides a way to update service definitions via HTTP calls.

Here is an example:

```bash
curl -u 'username:password' -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '@path/to/definition/file' 'http://localhost:8080/custom/admin/service-definition'
```

This interface can be used for both adding a new service or updating an existing one. For an existing service, if a plan that is in use is tried to be removed an exception will be thrown.

### Remove service definition

A service and its plan(s), which are not used i.e. which have no service instances, can be removed via a REST interface.
Here is an example for how to delete a service that has the id `service_id`:

```bash
curl -u 'username:password' -X DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/custom/admin/service-definition/{service_id}'
```

## Brokered Services
### Bosh based services
Any bosh based service can be easily brokered. See [here](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Abosh-release+org%3Aswisscom&type=Repositories) for Swisscom's bosh releases.  
Check the class [`BoshBasedServiceProvider`](broker/src/main/groovy/com/swisscom/cloud/sb/broker/services/bosh/BoshBasedServiceProvider.groovy) for details.
